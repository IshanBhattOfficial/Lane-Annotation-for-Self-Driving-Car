# Lane-Annotation-for-Self-Driving-Car

This notebook uses HoughLines Probabilistic to locate traffic-lanes as seen from a car dashboard.
I wrote this code as a first-implementation for an internship position I was applying with TCS-Limited.

Note: I noticed this code works best with opencv-python==4.1.2 and numpy==1.19.5
